# MKRF
Repository for the MKRF logging paper on control vs. thinned streams.
I wrote this paper in 2021 and published in Forest Ecology and Management with Peter Kiffney. This was a 4-year study on the effects of variable retention logging on streams in the Malcolm-Knapp research forest in British Columbia, Canada. This repository contains all of the data that was used for this project as well as the cleaned script for the analyses. 
Files:
control_thinned_cleaned.rmd is the analyses for the paper
cntrl_thinned_AFDM is the biofilm data
MKRE.TILE.INVERTS.ctrl_thinned is the invertebrate data
Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean are the mean, minimum, and maximum daily stream temperatures
EC_streamflow_2004-2007 is the streamflow data from East Creek
K-CK is the streamflow data from Griffith's creek
