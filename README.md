# MKRF
Repository for the MKRF logging paper on control vs. thinned streams.
I wrote this paper in 2021 and published in Forest Ecology and Management with Peter Kiffney. This was a 4-year study on the effects of variable retention logging on streams in the Malcolm-Knapp research forest in British Columbia, Canada. This repository contains all of the data that was used for this project as well as the cleaned script for the analyses.
